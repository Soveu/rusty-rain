# [EzEmoji](https://crates.io/crates/ezemoji)

This crate has changed so much over the development of it.  It started off where all the groups of emojis where just a enum variants of a Group enum.
Later I changed the enums variants to structure types so they could have a trait behavior.  This is not completely done as I would like to make a
derive macro for it so it would be super easy for a user to make a new one if ezemoji is missing a group. Also it would be fun to make this feature.
I was also suggested to make the not allocate on creation.  So this has made me think a lot about how to make this work.  As this project grows and morphs
so shall this page.  So come back to see how things turn out.
