# Welcome

Rusty Rain is a fast matrix rain program that can be customized from the color of the rain to the characters that are used.
Since version `0.2.0` Emoji rain is supported and let me tell ya, that is some funny stuff. This program is based on [CMatrix](https://github.com/abishekvashok/cmatrix)
by Chris Allegretta and Abishek V. Ashok  and inspired by [Unimatrix](https://github.com/will8211/unimatrix).

# Future

I would like to make this project avalible as a package on `Windows` and `Linux debian` OS's.  I do not have a Mac, so I'm not sure
If I can get something working for `brew` but I would like to try.
